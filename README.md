SimpleLPProblem
A Python implementation of a simple linear programming (LP) problem using the PuLP library. This implementation defines decision variables, an objective function, and constraints to solve a maximization problem. The LP problem is solved using the PuLP solver and the optimal solution values are tested using the unittest module.

Functionality
The TestLPProblem class defines a test case for the lp_problem function, which solves a simple LP problem with two decision variables, an objective function, and constraints. The LP problem is formulated as a maximization problem and the optimal solution values are asserted using the unittest assertions.

Usage
To use this implementation, simply import the TestLPProblem class from the unittest module and run it using the unittest.main() function. The TestLPProblem class contains a single test case test_lp_problem which solves the LP problem and asserts the optimal solution values.

Requirements
This implementation requires the following libraries to be installed:

PuLP: A linear programming library for Python. Install using pip install pulp.
unittest: A built-in module in Python for writing and running tests. No installation is required as it comes with Python.
